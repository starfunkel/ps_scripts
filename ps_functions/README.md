To Do:

Build fully automated and Windows platform dependent powershell profile


- set env's:
    - module install
        - on startup of powershell check if installed and install if not
    - may be time sonsuming --> testing required!

    - set path env's:
        - add repo path to $PATH var of Windows (This may be an alternative to dor sourcing all .ps1 files at every powershell startup)
